# Tank-Game

Still in development in my spare time.

A small artillery game inspired by the old classics 'Scorched Earth' for MS-DOS and 'Bang Bang' on Windows 3.1.
The player(s) take turns entering the velocity and angle of their shot to attempt to destroy the enemy player.

Written in Javascript utilising the HTML5 canvas element.

Disclaimer: This project is an avenue for me to learn more about JavaScript, particularly OOP in JS. Therefore the code herein may not conform all of the best practices or techniques, however I will be updating various implementations as development continues.

#Current features
- Procedurally generated terrain.
- Tank can move around the map
- Tank can shoot (ui for pointing the gun not yet implemented)
