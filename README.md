# Tank-Game

Still in development in my spare time.

A small artillery game inspired by the old classics 'Scorched Earth' for MS-DOS and 'Bang Bang' on Windows 3.1.
The player(s) take turns entering the velocity and angle of their shot to attempt to destroy the enemy player.

Written in Javascript utilising the HTML5 canvas element.

#Current features
- Procedurally generated terrain.
- Tank can move around the map
- Tank can shoot (limited: max 1 projectile on the screen at once, ui for pointing the gun not yet implemented)
